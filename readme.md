Using GitHub Copilot
What code did Copilot generate?
While working on this project, I used GitHub Copilot to assist with writing several scripts in Python. Copilot helped generate:

Function skeletons for data processing
Boilerplate code for file I/O
Suggestions for error handling and documentation
Did you modify the script? If so, why?
Yes, I modified the code generated by Copilot to:

Fix minor bugs and adapt the logic to fit the specific needs of my project
Improve readability and add comments
Ensure compatibility with the rest of my codebase
